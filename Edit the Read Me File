- Kaggle changes links/ file locations/login process/ file content - Kaggle has changed the locations, links and the way how we access. the direct download of CSV file is not allowed anymore. they have a Create KEY process by which we need to download the JSON file. then set the KEY FILE location and connect to Kaggle to download. Kaggle also provides API to access. once API was introduced, then accessing API is not normally given to anyone which is normal practice of programming . I have been involved in API access thru APIGEE product. my company vendors access the API through this and through AKAMAI services.

- We run out of space on HD / local permissions issue - can't save files - a. the compute instances can be created with bigger root device. normally in cloud, root devices are arround 20-30 GB. then we have to have our own data device. such case, multiple data device can be created and mounted. this can also be demounted any time to protect the data. root device will have only OS related. this way, destroying instance and recretaing is much easier

- Someone updated python packages and there is unintended effect (functions retired or act differently) - either the program needed to be reviewed and fixed for those deprecated functions. or go back to old version in order for current program to work provided old versions are supported yet.

- Docker issues - lost internet within docker due to some ip binding to vm or local routing issues( I guess this falls under lost internet, but I am talking more if docker is the cause rather then ISP). Unable to move further.
